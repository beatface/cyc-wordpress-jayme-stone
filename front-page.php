                  You’re a musician and you’ve been around the block a few times. You’ve had some success already but the momentum you expected wasn’t there. The support wasn’t there. The fantasy of making music while someone else took care of your career has vanished. You’ve tried to promote and book yourself, but it’s slow going and money’s still tight. You’re frustrated and you don’t know what to do.

              Every musician knows that. What they don’t know is what the old guard—the agents,
              publicists, managers, and record labels—knew all along. That is, how to actually run a business.
              <br><br>
              Maybe you’ve already tried being a do-it-yourselfer, so you know all too well how
              hard it is to figure things out. You probably wondered if you were missing something huge. You were.
              <br><br>
              And you’re not alone. Most musicians are sailing along in dark when it comes to their
              careers (though, they say “a smooth sea never made a good sailor”).
              <br><br>
              This comprehensive course changes that. Compose Your Career is for musicmakers like you
              who want to make the music you love—and a living at it too. It offers secrets and strategies that
              come from a guide (me—the guy who’s been called “the most organized musician on

              the planet”) who has stopped at nothing (okay, almost nothing) to design a workable system
              for independent musicians. It provides a disarmingly honest look at what’s really happening in the
              music industry and what it takes to propel your career forward.
              <br><br>
              As artists, we need to re-think and re-imagine what it means to do business. An artist’s business
              model is fundamentally different than that of a record label or booking agency. The good news? We
              have more latitude, choice, and creative freedom than ever before.
              <br><br>
              Compose your career puts tools and resources back into the hands of independent musicians. It
              shows musicmakers that their career is the ultimate improvisation—the grand music project that includes businesscraft too.

              That was a huge compliment, but it was also sobering. I’m moved
              by the astounding creativity of my friends and peers. How talented
              they are. And yet they ask for help because they are desperate to
              know how it all works. To stop struggling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I understand. I’ve been figuring out how to do this without a guide
              for almost twenty years. I’ve signed with a record label and have had
              managers and agents, but I’ve mostly done it myself. I’ve released
              five albums independently, raised $25,000 on Kickstarter, instigated
              a decade’s worth of collaborative projects, and booked hundreds of concerts myself.

              Last year, I began teaching a workshop called “How to Book Yourself
              Without an Agent” to answer many of the questions that fellow musicians
              had. Based on the success of those workshops, I set to work on a
              more comprehensive course—this course—that encompasses everything it
              takes to self-manage your career. What I’m offering is the hard-won
              knowledge I’ve accumulated that can uncover valuable opportunities for others.

          <p>
            As a banjoist, I’ve made six albums and won two Juno and three Canadian
            Folk Music Awards. I’ve booked myself successfully for fifteen years at venues
            ranging from the Lincoln and Kennedy Centres to Bumbershoot and the
            Vancouver Folk Festival. I pride myself on doing a better job than most agents.
            <br><br>
            As artists, I believe we can do a better job of representing ourselves and
            managing our own careers than most agents and managers because no one will
            care more than we do. We’re in it for the long haul and music isn’t just a
            living, it’s a life. There is no one better to represent our inner vision

              any artist who wants to get their act on stages and into festivals across
              North America. So much info is geared toward the ‘Sonicbids beginner
              artists’ out there, it’s hard for mid-level artists to find mentoring—but
              Jayme’s workshop is perfect for the pro artist who’s ready for the next level.
              Jayme is full of useful, creative, non-cliché info. Bring a thick pad of paper,
              you’ll want to take lots of notes!”
